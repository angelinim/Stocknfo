# Stocknfo


## Intro

Stocknfo is a stock market analysis tool that allows users to view up to date market data. It (currently) has 2 different technical indicators (RSI and MACD indicators) and candlestick charts. It also allows for users to create an account and follow stocks they are interested in.

## Technologies

This application uses Google Charts to display market data, Alpha Vantage API to get up to date market information, and Firebase Firestore to hold user information.

## Note

a fork of this repository will not allow one to run the app. In order to build the app from a fork of this repository one will need to get an api key from Alpha Vantage's website. However, I don't recommend it as I will soon be making a build that will allow users to demo the application.

## Disclaimer

This is a demo application owned by Michael Angelini. Feel free to use this as a reference.
